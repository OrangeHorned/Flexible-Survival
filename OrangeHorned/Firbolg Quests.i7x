	say "     Walking around the city has made you see many sights you never expected, you've come far from the person you once were into a world of hot lusts and temptations that once only existed in novels and shows. But one thing you were confused about is a scene of what looks like a cool colored giant with bull features tossing a saber kitty into a dumpster before turning it upside down. A group of uninfected people in the distance scramble for their lives as an older gentleman on the floor lay with ripped clothes and an erect cock. A Blue-skinned giant runs over to the soon to be mutant, holding their head up in worry. You've seen the nanite infection take people already, you already know from the spreading stripes upon their crotch that they're mostly a goner. The new claws of the robed man dig into the ground as the new lusts overwhelm their body.";

Their teeth dig into their bottom lip, choking the words, 'Father Samson... If I was just a little faster you wouldn't have...' The wrinkled hand reached their chin, comforting their grief, 'Please my child... I no longer hold that title, but if I have brought some into the light of god, then I will be at peace with this... demonic possession.' 'I...' His eyes flicker, as he speaks again. 'Please trust me... when I tell you that this isn't the way you're supposed to serve the world, I can fix this...' '...Giving?' The big fisherman unclicked their straps, pecs bounced from their prison, right onto the Priests face. 'If you become a Firbolg, you won't have to worry about your lusts, I will always be here to keep you from becoming those bastards on the streets.'";
			say "     'Your body... I could not wish to...' Samson gritted his teeth as his chest popped out fur, slowly growing breasts, he barely clings onto sanity, '...to...haa...this heat... I can't... Giving...' 'You told me yourself, the lord works in mysterious ways, you gave me hope to help you, I'm sure you were right that eventually this apocalypse will end, but I don't want you defiling yourself, not here.' With no other options, Samson silently agreed, his lips wrapped carefully around the swollen areola. At first it was just a small few suckles nipples from a man who clearly is not well versed in sex, but slowly the sucking became more fervorous as their other hand squeezed milk from the other nipple in a ravage lust. Their body turns a gray skin color as features of the wrinkled body become younger, slimmer, and shorter-- their shriveledcock growing to a knee knocking shaft with almost softball sized nuts.";

	say "     Something about the circumstances as to why you were here has your body in a cold sweat to every random noise in this oddly quiet section of the city. From what Knott and Giving had said, it was in some building with a large broken hole in it. The moment you find the most familiar thing to it, you peer inside to see a space that is almost like a model apartment, everything here was either torn up, musky, or moldy from all the fluids all over the place. Grazing over the place, you spend the next few minutes in silence going up floors of quiet-nothingness, until eventually spotting what definitely is the remains of some survivor hangout on the 5th floor. Finding the book is the easy part as it is lying on one of the tables to a kitchen set, the hard part is the current problem now of someone else on the floor stumbling in a hazed panic from something. It looks like a college survivor, but the last few days have not treated them well, his torn shirt and sunken eyes a product of his tragedy.";

His steps on the floor circle his prey  into a corner. 'Boy, listen, you must know this is the end of days, right? Everyone is having fun while you keep struggling fruitlessly, it's just pathetic. If anything, I'm saving you from your boredom to see a new world that you once feared with all your heart... your mother thought the same when I was on top... didn't you hear how her terror turned quickly into enjoyment? If you stayed longer... you would have heard her beg me to do the same to you~'";
	say "     The poor man is dejected from the situation, tears flow down his cheeks... yet no cry is heard. After losing all hope, he falls to his knees, giving his enemy the advantage.  The demon shifts his form to have a centaur's lower body, standing over him with the same, calm, expression.
